<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: remind the learner of the core idea(s) from the preceding learning-content unit (without mentioning the details of the exercise or the scenario)

    Header: do not add an H1 or H2 title here, the auto-generated H1 will appear above this content automatically

    Example: "A storage account represents a collection of settings that implement a business policy."

TODO: add your topic sentences(s)

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario covered in this exercise

    Header: a separate header is optional; you can combine this with the topic sentence in a single paragraph

    Example: "Recall that in the chocolate-manufacturer example, there would be a separate storage account for the private business data. There were two key requirements for this account: geographically-redundant storage because the data is business-critical and at least one location close to the main factory."

    Recommended: image that summarizes the entire scenario with a highlight of the area implemented in this exercise

<!-- 3. Task performed in the exercise ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what they'll implement here; that is, describe the end-state after completion

    Header: a separate header is optional; you can combine this with the sub-task into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will create a storage account with settings appropriate to hold this mission-critical business data."

    Optional: a video that shows the end-state
-->
TODO: describe the end-state

<!-- 4. Chunked steps -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the steps they'll do to complete the exercise.

    Structure: Break the steps into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. A header describing the goal of the chunk
        2. An introductory paragraph describing the goal of the chunk at a high level
        3. Numbered steps (target 7 steps or fewer in each chunk)

    Example:
        Header:
            "Use a template for your Azure logic app"
        Introduction:
             "When you create an Azure logic app in the Azure portal, you have the option of selecting a starter template. Let's select a blank template so that we can build our logic app from scratch."
        Steps:
             "1. In the left navigation bar, select Resource groups.
              2. Select the existing Resource group [sandbox resource group name].
              3. Select the ShoeTracker logic app.
              4. Scroll down to the Templates section and select Blank Logic App."

## [Chunk 2 header]
<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
1. <!-- Step 1 -->

## [Chunk n header]
<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
1. <!-- Step 1 -->

<!-- 5. Validation chunk -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Helps the learner to evaluate if they completed the exercise correctly.

    Structure: Break the steps into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. A header indicating the goal here is "check your work" rather than completing new work
        2. An introductory paragraph describing how they'll validate their work at a high level
        3. Numbered steps (when the learner needs to perform multiple steps to verify if they were successful)

    Example:
        Header:
            "Examine the results of your Twitter trigger"
        Introduction:
             "At this point, our logic app is scanning Twitter every minute for tweets containing the search text. To verify the app is running and working correctly, we'll look at the Runs history table."
        Steps:
             "1. Select Overview in the navigation menu.
              2. Select Refresh once a minute until you see a row in the Runs history table.
              ...
              6. Examine the data in the OUTPUTS section. For example, locate the text of the matching tweet."

1. <!-- Step n (if multiple steps are needed) -->
