<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: orient the learner to the area covered in this module

    Header: do not add an H1 or H2 title here, the auto-generated H1 will appear above this content automatically

    Example: "Implementing a business process can be challenging because you typically need to make diverse services work together.   Think about everything your company uses to store and process data: Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Oracle, Twitter, YouTube, Dropbox, Google services, Azure Cognitive Services, and so on. How do you integrate all these products? Azure Logic Apps gives you pre-built components to connect to hundreds of services. You use a graphical design tool to put the pieces together in any combination you need and Logic Apps will run your process automatically in the cloud."

    Recommended: visual like an image, table, list, etc. that supports the topic sentence(s)

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Header: use the H2 "Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company that is launching a new product. You sell the shoes on your website, manage your cloud-hosted advertising videos, and monitor social media to gauge reactions to the launch. The following illustration shows these processes. Notice how the tasks include both customer-facing processes like direct sales and administrative tasks like auto-archiving old videos."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

    [Scenario video guidance](TBD)

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Header: use the H2 "What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Weâ€™ll analyze the capabilities of Logic Apps and when to use them:
                - Launch: survey the conditions you can set to launch your app (time, data availability, etc.).
                - Connect: survey the services to which you can connect.
                - Branch: list the branching and looping features to add business logic.
                - Evaluate: identify when Logic Apps are the right product for your tasks (performance, available connectors, etc.).
                - Practice: apply the criteria to sample problems."

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: The title of an "Introduction to..." tells our customers that this is a good place to start their learning. This helps our customers find the right content quickly. The trade-off is that the title does not reflect the terminal learning objective of the module. The "goal" section of the introduction is your chance to provide the terminal learning objective. Write a statement that is outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Header: use the H2 "What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to decide whether Logic Apps is a good choice to automate your business processes."

## What is the main goal?
TODO: add your terminal learning objective

<!-- Do **not** include any other content like learning objectives, prerequisites, unit summary, "next unit" lead-in, or references. -->
